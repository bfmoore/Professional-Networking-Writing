                          Introduction
                          
                          
Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as 
input two numbers and the operation (+, -, /, *) to be performed. It should 
then output the numbers, the operator, and the result. (For division, if the 
denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.) Some sample input/output 
follow:
3 + 4 = 7
13 * 5 = 65

                      Methodology
                     
C ++ Pseudocode Project 3

Declare variable num1 to store the first number.
Declare variable num2 to store the second number.
Declare variable operation to store the operator.
Input expression 
Print “Enter a mathematical expression in the following format (num1, operator, num2)”
	Input num1, operation, num2
Get num1, operation, num2 from the user.
case operation value is +
print num1, operation, num2
case operation value is -
print num1, operation, num2
case operation value is *
print num1, operation, num2
case operation value is /
	if num2 is equal to zero
		print “Not allowed to divide by ZERO.”
	else
print num1, operation, num2
		default 
			print “An error has occurred, please try again! “


                    Results

It will display a message on the screen for user to enter mathematical expression such as:
  Enter mathematical expression in the follwing format (number 1 operator number2)
  200/20
  200 / 20 = 10

If an error occurs when entering the mathmetical express such as:
   Enter mathematical expression in the follwing format (number 1 operator number2)
   15
   20
   An error has occured, please try again!
   
                    
                    Conclusions
                    
   I learned how to write pseudocode for a mimics calculator. This allowed me to write a program in C++. 
   This program can be improved by adding algebra calculation to this features.
